<ISubtitleAndDesc title="The Situation">
  We were recently approached by one such client who had deployed the Magento2 on AWS but
was facing issues with the performance of their food retail application. The application was not
able to support multiple users due to a lack of proper environments for testing, so they were
constantly running buggy software that would crash at the drop of a hat.<br/><br/>The poor performance of their application meant that it could never run more than 10 or 15
users at once, making it impossible for the client to run marketing campaigns and grow the user
base.<br/><br/>Magento2 is a powerful platform, but it can work even better when deployed on AWS. When the
customer found itself struggling with multiple environments, performance optimization,
deployment, and project setup on Magento2, it turned to Easesol for help.<br/><br/>Easesol worked with them as a technical partner, determining the best practices in the
development process, providing expertise on infrastructure solutions, and preparing for GitOps
with CodeCommit and Magento2 Cloud.

<ISubtitleAndDesc title="The Problem">
  The client came to us with several problems:<br/><br/>The cause of these problems was a lack of multiple environments for their application—they
were performing everything in production, which meant that they were running buggy software
nearly all the time.<br/><br/>Application performance was so bad that only 10 to 15 users could use their application at any
given time. They were never able to run marketing campaigns to increase their user base or
drive more sales through their online platform.<br/><br/>They needed multiple environments for setting up their development, staging, and production
environments.<br/><br/>Magento2 is a very complex and powerful platform, but when used incorrectly it can be
incredibly slow and difficult to maintain.<br/><br/>Therefore, they needed help with the application deployment process for production. They did
not have a reliable way of deploying code to production before we stepped in.<br/><br/>Moreover, the client was challenged by the project initial setup on Magento2 Cloud. It's always
difficult to start working on a new project, especially when it's as complex as Magento2 Cloud.<br/><br/>So they wanted to follow the best practices for the development process given the complexity of
their codebase and workflow.<br/><br/>They came to Easesol because they were having trouble managing their cloud-based
applications. It was as if they had deployed the application on AWS, but it was still behaving as
though it was offline.<br/><br/>We were delighted to take on this challenge.

<ISubtitleAndDesc title="The Solution">
  One area where Easesol provides significant value is performance optimization. Because so
many elements go into application performance, it's essential that the right tools are in place to
measure its effectiveness. Easesol can help you identify any bottlenecks and create a detailed
plan to maximize your application's performance.<br/><br/>Since the application was based on Magento2 Cloud, we immediately knew we were the right
company to help.<br/><br/>Since Easesol is a veteran of Magento2 and AWS, we knew exactly how to structure the best
practices for the development and optimization of the application.<br/><br/>Easesol's team of experienced developers stepped in to take over as Technical Partner for
Magento2 deployed on AWS.<br/><br/>By participating in design and development while providing expertise on infrastructure solutions
and strategic direction, Easesol was able to manage Magento2 cloud and AWS services with
ease.<br/><br/>Easesol revamped the complete infrastructure to run the application in a highly available
manner. Moreover, Easesol created CI/CD pipelines for multiple environments.<br/><br/>Easesol also managed Magento2 based application releases, provided expertise on system
architecture, prepared technical requirements from functional requirements, and set up GitOps
with CodeCommit and Magento2 Cloud.<br/><br/>When all was done, the client had gone from a slow-moving infrastructure project to a
fast-and-easy one that helped them get their product to market faster than ever.

<ISubtitleAndDesc title="The Result">
  After careful analysis of the company's needs and goals, Easesol delivered solutions that
addressed all of their problems.<br/><br/>Thanks to Easesol's help with infrastructure, strategic direction, system architecture, and
technical requirements, the institute is now able to use Magento2 Application deployed on AWS
effectively and take advantage of its benefits.<br/><br/>We worked as technical partners for their Magento2 Application, and we know that's why they
got the results they did.<br/><br/>Within six months, we had reduced application downtime by 37%, meaning our client could
reach more customers and make more sales as a result of our work.<br/><br/>The best part? We're ready to do it all again—for you!
