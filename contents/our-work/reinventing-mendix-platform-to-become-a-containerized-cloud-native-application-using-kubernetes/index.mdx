<ISubtitleAndDesc title="The Situation">
  Easesol is a leading international cloud services provider that helps businesses with cloud
transformation by implementing cloud solutions that best suit their needs. They aim to help
enterprises set up and manage their cloud without the complexity and cost of hiring their own
internal IT engineer staff.<br/><br/>A UAE-based Government Institute approached Easesol as it was looking for a solution that
would help them deploy their large number of applications (about 26 Mendix applications).<br/><br/>They were looking for the latest technologies to manage their system and handle the
deployment process and testing. They needed a system that could work within the limitations
imposed by using the public cloud.<br/><br/>For Easesol, this UAE-based government institute was just another client with an interesting
problem: they needed their cloud services to be restructured and optimized to better suit the
nature of their business as a government agency that serves the people.<br/><br/>But Easesol didn't take this job as "just another" anything—instead, they approached it with
fresh eyes and a desire to help them make their IT solution one that would work for them in the
long run.

<ISubtitleAndDesc title="The Problem">
  The client, a government institute based in UAE, wanted to enhance their deployment velocity
and application reliability by moving at the speed of the market. To achieve this, they adopted
containers and Kubernetes as they wanted the latest technology, to containerize workloads and
services.<br/><br/>However, they were afraid of the learning curve associated with containers and Kubernetes and
weren't sure if Mendix was compatible with Kubernetes.<br/><br/>They also didn't have an automated deployment process for their applications, so they were
happy to hear about how Easesol could help them deploy their application within 5 minutes as
opposed to the 30 minutes or so it took before.<br/><br/>Finally, they needed training for their staff on how to manage containerized applications on
Kubernetes. Therefore, Easesol also trained their staff to manage their application loads on
Kubernetes so that they would be able to support themselves going forward.

<ISubtitleAndDesc title="The Solution">
  Easesol was able to empower the customer with digital transformation with Containers and
Kubernetes, we were able to help them adopt Kubernetes on-premises to ensure security and
create multiple environments for them to deploy their apps across.<br/><br/>After working with software and security engineers, as well as their Solution architect, Easesol
built a reliable platform that could get the job done. Also, to get the source from SVN to GIT,
Eassol prepared CI/CD on Gitlab for multiple Mendix based applications and automated scripts.<br/><br/>It enabled them to optimize resources, enhance collaboration and streamline business
processes. Whereas, containerizing applications simplified the app management, making it
easier for them to build, deploy, update, test, and scale each service independently.<br/><br/>However, the institute was not sure how this infrastructure provision would help them to resolve
their issue, or how they would deal with various issues in the future after leveraging this service
from Easesol.<br/><br/>After working with Easesol, the company is more confident about managing its applications to
be more efficient and provide better results. They performed chaos engineering and platform
load testing on an on-premises Kubernetes cluster for both production and staging
environments.
